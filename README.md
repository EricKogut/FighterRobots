# FighterRobots
This is my grade 12 summative project. This project will feature a number of fighting robots using AI in order to fight each other.

Version 1: TestfighterRobt - attacks the closest robot.
Version 2: OmegaBot - attacks robot with the lowest health.
Version 3: BetaBot - looks at health and distance to determine best robot to attack.
Version 4: AlphaBot - factors in health, distance, attack/defence history and a pile value to determine the best robot to attack. This utlises custom OppData to store said data (KogutOppData). This robot was easily the most successful in large and small scale fights.

Note: if you are currently creating a fighter robot contact me for any help :)
